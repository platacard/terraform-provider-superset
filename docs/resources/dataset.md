# superset_dataset (Resource)

Manages a dataset in Superset.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "superset_dataset" "example" {
  table_name    = "example_table"
  database_name = "PostgreSQL"
  schema        = "public"
  sql = <<-EOF
    WITH recursive_sequence AS (
      SELECT 1 as level, 1 as value, 'Level One' as description
      UNION ALL
      SELECT 
        level + 1,
        value * 2,
        CASE 
          WHEN level + 1 <= 3 THEN CONCAT('Level ', 
            CASE level + 1 
              WHEN 2 THEN 'Two'
              WHEN 3 THEN 'Three'
            END)
          ELSE 'Max Level'
        END
      FROM recursive_sequence 
      WHERE level < 5
    ),
    calculated_data AS (
      SELECT 
        level,
        value,
        description,
        value * 1.5 as weighted_value,
        ROUND(LOG(value), 2) as log_value,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY level) as row_num
      FROM recursive_sequence
    )
    SELECT 
      level as hierarchy_level,
      value as base_value,
      weighted_value,
      log_value,
      description as level_description,
      CASE 
        WHEN row_num % 2 = 0 THEN 'Even'
        ELSE 'Odd'
      END as parity,
      NOW() as generated_timestamp
    FROM calculated_data
    ORDER BY level
  EOF
}
```
